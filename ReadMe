duplicate_file.py is a Python 3 script that copies a file into the directory where it is called from. Example:

python3 duplicate_file.py /home/landscape.jpg


The previous command will copy landscape.jpg into the current working directory and name it landscape-copy.jpg. It can be imported
as a module and copy a file by calling the copy function with the file path as the argument.

This was a good practice to work with file paths.
